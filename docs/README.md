# BATS.py
Python bindings for the [BATS library](https://github.com/bnels/BATS).

Note that the C++ repository is the main library, and contains more features.  This repository provides bindings for a subset of the functionality of BATS, and is under active development.

For background on what this repository does, refer to the paper [Persistent and Zigzag Homology: A Matrix Factorization Viewpoint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10693) by Gunnar Carlsson, Anjan Dwaraknath, and Bradley J. Nelson.
